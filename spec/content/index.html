    Poor quality discharge information is a major barrier to safe and effective transitions. With 45% of Medicare
    beneficiaries requiring post-acute care (PAC) services after hospitalization, the need for a seamless exchange of
    health information is great.
</p>
<p>
    In 2014, the Social Security Act was amended to include the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation
    (IMPACT) Act, which required the standardization and interoperability of patient assessment in specific categories
    for post-acute care (PAC) settings, including long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), home health agencies (HHAs), skilled
    nursing facilities (SNFs), and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). It focuses on standardizing data elements
    in specified quality measure domains and patient assessment domains for cross setting comparison and clinical
    information exchange, respectively. The Act requires:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reporting of standardized patient assessment data through commonly used PAC assessment instruments for LTCHs,
        SNFs, HHAs, and IRFs
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum Data Set (MDS)for SNFs</li>
        <li>Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility – Patient Assessment Information (IRF – PAI) for IRFs</li>
        <li>LTCH Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (CARE) Data Set (LCDS) for LTCHs</li>
        <li>Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for HHAs</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Implementation of data elements specified in each assessment domain using standardized data elements to be
        nested within the assessment instruments currently required for submission by LTCH, IRF, SNF, and HHA providers
    </li>
    <li>
        Data to be standardized and interoperable to allow exchange of data between PAC providers, among others, using
        common standards and definitions to provide access to longitudinal information and facilitate coordinated care.
    </li>
</ul>

    Interoperability challenges persist in post-acute care; providers are not receiving complete and accurate
    information in a timely manner, leading to patient harm, adverse outcomes, and additional expense. Failure to
    exchange accurate, timely data often leads to inefficient workflows, duplicative data entries, and increased risk of
    patient harm attributable to missing or inaccurate information. Health IT can significantly alleviate this
    administrative burden by exchanging post-acute care assessments and associated clinical information between care
    settings to ensure that the receiving care setting has all of the relevant information they need to best treat the
    incoming patient, improving patient outcomes, reducing provider burden, improving cost efficiencies, and improving
    workflows. Moreover, it would allow for advanced computability, standardization, usability, and real-time analytics
    for PAC facilities, enabling broader use by health IT developers, researchers, providers, and payers.

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
    The PACIO Project is a collaborative effort to advance interoperable health data exchange between post-acute care
    (PAC) and other providers, patients, and key stakeholders across health care and to promote health data exchange in
    collaboration with policy makers, standards organizations, and industry through a consensus-based approach.
</p>
<p>
    The primary goal of the PACIO Project is to establish a framework for the development of Fast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resource (FHIR) technical implementation guides and reference implementations that will facilitate
    health data exchange through standards-based use case-driven application programming interfaces (APIs).

    Mobility question code - ex. GG0130 for Self Care. Alternatively, Care Setting
